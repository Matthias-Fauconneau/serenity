CG:
 correct shadow setup: max depth scale
 tesselate cylinders
 precompute all attributes (light pos), only 16x vectorized view matrix multiply.
 Renderer: step grids for vertex attribute interpolations ? coverage sampling ? Hi-Z pixel reject ? float16 colors ?
 copy-paste
 hardware rendering
 export .obj
 Textures (bark,leafs,twigs),
 XCompose, syntax highlighting
 Plants: Mycelys muralis, Lychnis coronaria, Mint, Crocus, Lily-of-the-valley, Apple twig, Lilac, Wild carrot, Zinnias, Water lily, Roses, Tree leafs
 Better trees using environment modeling (light and space competition)
 Scene (sky, grass, plants, forest, terrain...)
IDE: text editor, parser(inherited attributes, scoped symbols, GLR), syntax highlighting, navigation, completion, git
Touchbook: hardware scroll, fix touchscreen, accelerometer trigger, portrait, onscreen keyboard, handwriting recognition
Standards: deflate, jpeg, mp3, vorbis, truetype, ssl
Apps: runner, shell, file manager, search, imap, torrent, video, irc
