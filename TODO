Analyzer:
 - Set speed, Loop on selection, fix seek
 - Display piano mask on spectrogram (to better match notes)
 - Better visualisation (to better filter harmonics)

 - Tempo estimation, Discrete note detection, Full rhythm tracking
 - Harmonic estimation, Chord detection, Full melody tracking
 - Timbre estimation, Track detection, Full intrument tracking

 - User-assisted music sheet transcription
 - Extract instruments for sampling (or modeling)

Passive Reflectance Synthesis:
 - show expected poles on frequency response plot

Piano:
 Realistic mode:
  Compute running average of velocities, limit offset from average to 2x (but contribute fully to average computation) ?
  Continuous scroll (~4-60px/s) ?
 Practice mode:
  Allow up to twice too slow
  Repeat from previous bar/line/mark if too many note/beat errors
 Record mode:
  Stitch best lines
  Sync webcam

CG: Trees: improve branches using environment modeling (light and space competition), Textures: bark,leafs,twigs, Export .obj
Touchbook: fast render, fix touchscreen, rotate screen, accelerometer trigger, onscreen keyboard, handwriting recognition
Text Editor: mouse select, shift select, delete selection, X11 cut/copy
IDE: text editor, syntax highlighting, build/run integration, parser(inherited attributes, scoped symbols, GLR), navigation, completion
