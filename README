Usage: 
 Command line arguments are interpreted as targets, paths or arguments (can be interleaved in any order).
 The first path to a folder is the path to the folder containing the source data set image slices (shorthand form of the "path" argument)
 Targets can be any output result from a production rule of the process definition.
 Each target will be copied to the corresponding target path (i.e first target with first target path, ...).
 Arguments affects either the process definition or the operations themselves.

Targets and arguments:
- source
  Image slices from the "path" folder concatenated as a volume.
  - path
    Path to the slice images folder (or to a volume file)
    \note Folder names of the form "name-resolution" can be used to automatically assign the correct input resolution (in nm).
              Otherwise the "resolution" argument will be used (default: 1μm)
  - downsample = [0]|1
    Downsamples the volume by two.
    \note Unlike "resample", the full resolution is never stored in memory as downsampling is done as the slices are loaded.
  - cylinder = x,y,r,z0,z1 | r
    Crops the volume to the cylinder of radius r centered at (x,y) including all slices of coordinate z with z0<=z<z1 (i.e excluding z1 slice for a total z1-z0 slices)
    \note Voxel coordinates starts from zero
  - extra
    Adds 5 voxels to the cylinder to compensate for margins lost to processing
  \note It can be useful to store the cropped/downsampled source volume on the filesystem when extracting/downsampling from a large original dataset takes a long time.
- name
  The name of the data set (i.e everything before any dash in the "path" folder name)
- resolution
  The resolution of the data set in μm (i.e number after the dash in the folder name divided by 1000)
  \note The "downsample" argument will properly double the resolution.
- voxelSize
  The number of voxels of the source volume in each dimension
- physicalSize
  The physical size of the source volume in each dimension
- denoised
  The denoised volume
  - denoise = 0|average (unused)|[median]
    Selects the denoising method. Median filtering is recommended. Downsampling should be used instead of average filter. No filter should be used on already clean samples.
- resampled
  The resampled volume
  - resample = [0]|1 (unused)
    Resamples the denoised volume from resolution to process-resolution
    - "process-resolution" must be given (in the same unit as "resolution" (e.g μm))
- histogram-radiodensity
  Histogram of the radiodensities (voxels versus radiodensity value)
  - thresholdFromSource = [0]|1 (unused)
    Selects whether to evaluate the histogram from the source or the denoised/resampled volume.
    \note The threshold will only be optimal if computed on the processed volume (default)
- distribution-radiodensity
  Estimates the underlying radiodensity probability density (using kernel density estimation on the histogram)
  \note Radiodensity is normalized to the 0-1 range and area is normalized to 1 (i.e correct probability density function)
- threshold
  The uniform radiodensity threshold used to segment pores
  - threshold = [otsu]|gradient|lorentz|<decimal>|<integer>
   The threshold determination method to use or a manual threshold (given either in normalized or integer radiodensity)
   \note Otsu is the recommended robust statistic method, gradient is for backward compatibility only, Lorentz is an explicit model which may be more accurate but is prone to fail.
   \note otsu-interclass-deviation[-normalized], gradient-mean, lorentz-parameters, lorentz-rock, lorentz-notrock, lorentz-pore, lorentz-notpore can be used for insight in the determination.
- colorize (visualization)
  Visualization of radiodensities colored by the binary segmentation (pore in green, rock in red)
- distance (internal)
  Distance field (squared distance from every pore voxel to the nearest rock voxel)
- skeleton (internal)
  Integer medial axis skeleton (squared radius of all largest spheres)
- pruned (internal)
  Skeleton without the smallest pores
  - minimalSqRadius = [0]|<integer>
   Sets every skeleton voxel with a squared radius less than or equal to minimalSqRadius to 0 (rock)
- crop (internal)
  Cropped processed volume to remove boundary bias effects (before floodfill to avoid hidden connections)
  - crop.cylinder = x,y,r,z0,z1 | r
   Specification of the cylinder to crop in the original source coordinate (i.e before source crop (not this input))
- transposed (internal)
 Transposed volume (to use an alternate connectivity axis when floodfilling)
 - transpose = X|Y|[Z]
  Input axis to map to the output Z axis
- connected (internal)
 Skeleton without unconnected pores
 floodfill = 0|[1]
  Selects whether to discard unconnected pores
- histogram-radius[-scaled]
 Histogram of the pore radii (voxels versus radius)
 \note This histogram is the square root of the histogram of squared distance (which is integer as voxel coordinates are integer).
           The original histogram contains all integers r². Since √''<0, bins gets closer as r² increases.
           As bins are not uniformly spaced anymore, the result cannot be interpreted as a discrete probability density
 \note histogram-radius-scaled has the X axis scaled from voxels to μm (using "resolution")
- volume-distribution-radius[-scaled]
 Pore size distribution estimated from radius histogram
 \note The result is unnormalized (i.e not a PDF (probability density function)) to compare with the histogram
- distribution-radius[-scaled]
 Pore size distribution normalized by the total volume (including rock (not a PDF (sums to porosity (and not 1))))
- volume
  Volume of the connected pore space in voxels
- volume-total
  Total volume of the discrete cylinder in voxels
- porosity
  Relative volume of the pore space (i.e pore space volume over total volume)
- mean-radius
  Mean radius of the pores
- cdl
  Volume of the rounded maximum radii exported in CDL format (to be converted to a netCDF file using ncgen)
- ascii
  Volume of the rounded maximum radii exported in ASCII format (one sample per line formatted as "x, y, z, r")
- png-{source,denoised,colorize,distance,skeleton,maximum}
  Image slices of the volume exported in PNG format (normalized and gamma-compressed for visualization)
- bmp-{source,denoised,distance,skeleton,maximum}
  Image slices of the volume exported in BMP format (unnormalized and linear for interoperation)
- [bmp-]denoised-connected
  Denoised volume with all unconnected pores set to "value"
  - value = <decimal>|<integer>
   Radiodensity value to set masked voxels
