    - sound/MIDI (alsa)

– GUI system
    - text (freetype)
    - image (ico,png,jpeg)
    - widgets (scroll, button, slider)
    - layout (bar, list, grid)

\section build Build system

Source dependencies for an application (given by $TARGET) are resolved by dep.py, linking all sources (.cc) corresponding to included headers (.h).

Make is used to track header dependencies and incrementally build (using flags depending on $BUILD={debug,profile,release})

The Qt Creator IDE project file offers preset build configurations for the existing applications

\section Installation

 Usage: install.sh APPLICATION

Available applications:
- taskbar: Shows active tasks (i.e open windows) in a panel and acts as a minimal X11 window manager
- desktop: Displays a feed reader, an event calendar and an application launcher (activated by taskbar home button)
- player: Music player with a two-column interface (albums/track), gapless playback and persistence of last track+position.
- music: SFZ sampler and PDF renderer (tested with Salamander)
