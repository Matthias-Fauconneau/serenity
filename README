\section build Build system

Source dependencies for an application (given by $TARGET) are resolved by dep.py, linking all sources (.cc) corresponding to included headers (.h).

Make is used to track header dependencies and incrementally build (using flags depending on $BUILD={debug,profile,release}).

The Qt Creator IDE project file offers preset build configurations for the existing applications.

\section Installation

 Usage: install.sh APPLICATION

Available applications:
- \ref taskbar.cc "taskbar": Shows active tasks (i.e open windows) in a panel and acts as a minimal X11 window manager.
- \ref desktop.cc "desktop": Displays a \ref Feeds "feed reader", an \ref Events "event calendar" and an application launcher.
- \ref player.cc "player": Music player with a two-column interface (albums/track), gapless playback and persistence of last track+position (supports FLAC and mp3).
