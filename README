Usage: install.sh APPLICATION

Available applications:
taskbar: Shows active tasks (i.e open windows) in a panel and acts as a minimal X11 window manager
desktop: Displays a feed reader, an event calendar and an application launcher (activated by taskbar home button)
player: Music player with a two-column interface (albums/track), gapless playback and persistence of last track+position.
music: SFZ sampler and PDF renderer (tested with Salamander)

These applications are developed using an elegant C++11 framework including:
– Runtime support: array, string, log, stack trace, profile, disassembly.
– Platform abstraction: file/network/thread (Linux), window (X11), sound/MIDI (alsa).
– GUI system: text (freetype), image (ico,png,jpeg), button, slider, layout (bar,list,grid).
